After we got both Defect Density and Coverages, to calculate the Spearman correlation, we used f(x)=CORREL(RANK.AVG(Defect 
Density),RANK.AVG(Coverages)) in excel. The result from Spearman showed that there has a strong negative relation between Defect Density 
and Coverages. It means that with the increase of both statement and branch coverage, the defect density will decrease.
